A GitHub action that can be used to run vulnerability checks using the [10up WP-CLI Vulnerability Scanner](https://github.com/10up/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner).

## Inputs

### `api-provider`
The Vulnerability API provider to use. Supported values are `wordfence`, `patchstack` and `wpscan`. Default `wordfence`.

### `api-token`
The API token to use for the Vulnerability API provider. Default `''`. Required if `api-provider` is `wpscan` or `patchstack`. (`wordfence` does not require an API token but does accept one for more robust scanning.)

### `type`
The type of scan to run. Supported values are `plugin` and `theme`. `core` is supported in an experimental state. Default `plugin`.

### `name`
The name of the plugin or theme to scan. Defaults to the name of the repository.

## Example usage

```yaml
uses: jazzsequence/action-wordpress-vulnerability-scanner@v1
with:
  api-provider: 'patchstack'
  api-token: ${{ secrets.PATCHSTACK_API_TOKEN }}
  type: 'plugin'
  name: 'my-plugin'
```
